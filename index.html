        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>            
            Hi there! I’m Megan, a 33-year-old tech enthusiast with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. My journey began in North Dakota and led me to Denver, CO, in 2012. After exploring various roles, I discovered my passion for software development and returned to school to pursue it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My background includes customer support experience at a startup VoIP company, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of user needs in a SaaS environment. I’m excited to blend these skills with my technical expertise to create innovative solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are a few projects I’m particularly proud of:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flourish:</strong> A mobile app designed to support mental health, built with Kotlin in Android Studio.</li>
            <li><strong>StreamStamp:</strong> A Chrome extension developed through a freelance project, showcasing my ability to create practical, user-friendly tools.</li>
            <li><strong>MegaBot:</strong> An interactive bot I created for various server functions, demonstrating my skills in building engaging digital experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I value transparency and have chosen to discuss my GPA to provide context of my academic journey and the struggles I had and overcame. My GPA of 2.71 reflects a challenging but ultimately rewarding journey. Early on, I struggled with test anxiety, which significantly affected my performance. However, I proactively sought support and developed strategies to manage this challenge. Despite this, my final two semesters—containing some of the most difficult senior and upper-level courses—were where I saw significant improvement. Achieving GPAs of 3.0 and 3.5 during these rigorous courses underscores my resilience and ability to excel under pressure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I’m excited to apply my blend of technical skills and customer-focused experience to new opportunities.
