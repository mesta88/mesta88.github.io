        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I’m Megan, a 33-year-old tech enthusiast who recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. My journey began in North Dakota and led me to Denver, CO, in 2012. After a variety of roles, I discovered my passion for software development and made the decision to return to school to pursue it more seriously.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My professional background includes customer support experience at a startup VoIP company, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of user needs within a SaaS environment. Now, I’m excited to blend these skills with my technical expertise to create impactful solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are a few projects that I’m particularly proud of:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#flourish"><strong>Flourish:</strong></a> A mobile app designed to support mental health, built with Kotlin in Android Studio.</li>
            <li><a href="#streamstamp"><strong>StreamStamp:</strong></a> A Chrome extension developed through a freelance project, showcasing my ability to create practical, user-friendly tools.</li>
            <li><a href="#megabot"><strong>MegaBot:</strong></a> An interactive bot I created for various server functions, demonstrating my skills in building engaging digital experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I believe in being transparent about my journey, including my GPA, to provide a complete picture of my academic path and the struggles I’ve faced. My cumulative GPA of 2.71 reflects a challenging period where I grappled with severe test anxiety. This anxiety significantly impacted my performance and led to some tough times, including having to retake courses.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Despite these challenges, I was determined to improve. I sought support, developed strategies to manage my anxiety, and persevered through it. My final two semesters—comprising some of the most difficult senior and upper-level courses—were where I began to see real progress. Achieving GPAs of 3.0 and 3.5 in these rigorous courses not only demonstrates my academic improvement but also my resilience and ability to excel under pressure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. I’m eager to bring my unique blend of technical skills and customer-focused experience to new opportunities and contribute positively to a dynamic team.
