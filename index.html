        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I’m Megan, a passionate 33-year-old with a fresh Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My adventure began in the small town of North Dakota and took me to the vibrant city of Denver, CO, back in 2012. After exploring various career paths, I found my true calling in software development, leading me to return to school and dive headfirst into the world of coding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My professional journey includes working in customer support at a dynamic VoIP startup. It was there that I refined my problem-solving skills and learned the art of understanding user needs in a fast-paced SaaS environment. Now, I’m thrilled to merge these insights with my technical know-how to build innovative and impactful solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are a few projects that showcase what I’ve been up to:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#flourish"><strong>Flourish:</strong></a> A mobile app crafted with Kotlin in Android Studio, designed to support mental health and well-being.</li>
            <li><a href="#streamstamp"><strong>StreamStamp:</strong></a> A Chrome extension I built during a freelance project, highlighting my ability to create user-friendly and practical tools.</li>
            <li><a href="#megabot"><strong>MegaBot:</strong></a> An engaging interactive bot that I developed for server functions, showcasing my skills in creating fun and functional digital experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I’m all about transparency and want to share a bit about my GPA to give you a fuller picture of my journey. My cumulative GPA of 2.71 reflects a challenging chapter where I wrestled with severe test anxiety. This struggle was real and impacted my performance, even leading to some course retakes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But here’s where the story takes a turn: I was determined to turn things around. I sought help, developed strategies to manage my anxiety, and faced my challenges head-on. My final two semesters were not only my toughest academically, but also the ones where I made the most significant strides. Achieving GPAs of 3.0 and 3.5 during these demanding senior and upper-level courses is a testament to my resilience and growth under pressure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thank you for stopping by my portfolio. I’m excited to bring my unique blend of technical skills and customer-focused experience to new opportunities and contribute positively to a vibrant team. Let’s create something amazing together!

                Welcome to <strong>Flourish</strong>, a vibrant productivity app that blossoms with your success! Created as part of my senior experience course, Flourish is crafted in Kotlin and designed to make staying motivated an enjoyable journey. Picture this: a virtual plant that grows and thrives based on your daily achievements. Each completed task nurtures your plant with essential care like watering and sunlight, turning your productivity into a flourishing garden of success.
            </p>
            <p>
                The beauty of Flourish lies in its approach to motivation—it's all about positive reinforcement. If you ever hit a rough patch and your plant starts to wilt, don't worry! Just get back on track, and you'll see your plant rejuvenate and grow into a stunning, blooming masterpiece. This gentle encouragement helps maintain motivation without the stress or guilt that often accompanies goal-setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the plant care, Flourish includes a sleek calendar that syncs with your tasks and goals. Whether you need to plan out your days or set deadlines, the calendar is your handy tool for organization. Plus, our fun "shop" feature rewards your hard work with virtual coins. Spend these coins on exciting upgrades like new plants, decorative pots, pot skins, and even greenhouse environments to create a personalized and enchanting virtual space.
            </p>
            <p>
                While our ambitious vision for Flourish was to include a fully integrated calendar and a wider array of virtual rewards, our one-semester timeframe limited our scope. Despite these constraints, we’re proud of the app’s core concept and its potential to transform productivity into a rewarding experience. Flourish is a testament to the blend of motivation and innovation, aimed at creating a supportive and inviting space for achieving your goals.
