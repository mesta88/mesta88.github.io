        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I’m Megan, a passionate 33-year-old with a fresh Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My adventure began in the small town of North Dakota and took me to the vibrant city of Denver, CO, back in 2012. After exploring various career paths, I found my true calling in software development, leading me to return to school and dive headfirst into the world of coding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My professional journey includes working in customer support at a dynamic VoIP startup. It was there that I refined my problem-solving skills and learned the art of understanding user needs in a fast-paced SaaS environment. Now, I’m thrilled to merge these insights with my technical know-how to build innovative and impactful solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are a few projects that showcase what I’ve been up to:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#flourish"><strong>Flourish:</strong></a> A mobile app crafted with Kotlin in Android Studio, designed to support mental health and well-being.</li>
            <li><a href="#streamstamp"><strong>StreamStamp:</strong></a> A Chrome extension I built during a freelance project, highlighting my ability to create user-friendly and practical tools.</li>
            <li><a href="#megabot"><strong>MegaBot:</strong></a> An engaging interactive bot that I developed for server functions, showcasing my skills in creating fun and functional digital experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I’m all about transparency and want to share a bit about my GPA to give you a fuller picture of my journey. My cumulative GPA of 2.71 reflects a challenging chapter where I wrestled with severe test anxiety. This struggle was real and impacted my performance, even leading to some course retakes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But here’s where the story takes a turn: I was determined to turn things around. I sought help, developed strategies to manage my anxiety, and faced my challenges head-on. My final two semesters were not only my toughest academically, but also the ones where I made the most significant strides. Achieving GPAs of 3.0 and 3.5 during these demanding senior and upper-level courses is a testament to my resilience and growth under pressure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thank you for stopping by my portfolio. I’m excited to bring my unique blend of technical skills and customer-focused experience to new opportunities and contribute positively to a vibrant team. Let’s create something amazing together!

                Dive into <strong>Flourish</strong>, a unique productivity app where your achievements grow a virtual garden of success! Developed using Kotlin for my senior experience course, Flourish transforms everyday tasks into a journey of growth and motivation. The concept is simple yet powerful: your virtual plant thrives on the care you provide by completing your tasks and goals. Each accomplishment waters, nourishes, or provides sunlight to your plant, helping it flourish into a beautiful and vibrant entity.
            </p>
            <p>
                What sets Flourish apart is its emphasis on positive reinforcement and self-compassion. Instead of guilt-tripping you for falling behind, the app gently encourages you to get back on track whenever your plant wilts. Witnessing your plant’s revival and growth can be incredibly motivating, turning productivity into a rewarding and visually satisfying experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to plant care, Flourish features a practical calendar that integrates seamlessly with your tasks and goals. It helps you plan your days or set deadlines, keeping you organized and on top of your schedule. And for a touch of fun and personalization, the app includes a "shop" where you can spend virtual coins—earned through daily challenges or consistent care—to purchase new plants, decorative pots, pot skins, and even greenhouse environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key feature is the built-in Journal, which serves as a handy text editor for jotting down thoughts, ideas, or reflections. This addition complements the productivity-focused elements of the app by providing a space for users to capture and organize their ideas effortlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on Flourish was a significant milestone in my journey as it was one of the rare opportunities where my team and I had complete creative freedom. Unlike traditional assignments with strict guidelines, we were encouraged to bring our vision to life. This freedom allowed us to explore innovative ideas and create something truly meaningful, reflecting our passion and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we faced time constraints with just one semester to develop the app, and some features like the full calendar functionality and additional virtual rewards were not fully implemented, Flourish remains a proud accomplishment. It represents a blend of creativity, motivation, and technical skill, and it showcases how meaningful and enjoyable productivity can be.
