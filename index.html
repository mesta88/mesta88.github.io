        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I’m Megan, a passionate 33-year-old with a fresh Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My adventure began in the small town of North Dakota and took me to the vibrant city of Denver, CO, back in 2012. After exploring various career paths, I found my true calling in software development, leading me to return to school and dive headfirst into the world of coding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My professional journey includes working in customer support at a dynamic VoIP startup. It was there that I refined my problem-solving skills and learned the art of understanding user needs in a fast-paced SaaS environment. Now, I’m thrilled to merge these insights with my technical know-how to build innovative and impactful solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are a few projects that showcase what I’ve been up to:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#flourish"><strong>Flourish:</strong></a> A mobile app crafted with Kotlin in Android Studio, designed to support mental health and well-being.</li>
            <li><a href="#streamstamp"><strong>StreamStamp:</strong></a> A Chrome extension I built during a freelance project, highlighting my ability to create user-friendly and practical tools.</li>
            <li><a href="#megabot"><strong>MegaBot:</strong></a> An engaging interactive bot that I developed for server functions, showcasing my skills in creating fun and functional digital experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            I’m all about transparency and want to share a bit about my GPA to give you a fuller picture of my journey. My cumulative GPA of 2.71 reflects a challenging chapter where I wrestled with severe test anxiety. This struggle was real and impacted my performance, even leading to some course retakes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But here’s where the story takes a turn: I was determined to turn things around. I sought help, developed strategies to manage my anxiety, and faced my challenges head-on. My final two semesters were not only my toughest academically, but also the ones where I made the most significant strides. Achieving GPAs of 3.0 and 3.5 during these demanding senior and upper-level courses is a testament to my resilience and growth under pressure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thank you for stopping by my portfolio. I’m excited to bring my unique blend of technical skills and customer-focused experience to new opportunities and contribute positively to a vibrant team. Let’s create something amazing together!
