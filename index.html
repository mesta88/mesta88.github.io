        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>            
            Hi there! I’m Megan, a 33-year-old tech enthusiast with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. My journey began in North Dakota and led me to Denver, CO, in 2012. After exploring various roles, I discovered my passion for software development and returned to school to pursue it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My background includes customer support experience at a startup VoIP company, where I developed strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of user needs in a SaaS environment. I’m excited to blend these skills with my technical expertise to create innovative solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here are a few projects I’m particularly proud of:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#flourish"><strong>Flourish:</strong></a> A mobile app designed to support mental health, built with Kotlin in Android Studio.</li>
            <li><a href="#streamstamp"><strong>StreamStamp:</strong></a> A Chrome extension developed through a freelance project, showcasing my ability to create practical, user-friendly tools.</li>
            <li><a href="#megabot"><strong>MegaBot:</strong></a> An interactive bot I created for various server functions, demonstrating my skills in building engaging digital experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
I believe in being open about my journey, including my GPA, to give you a fuller picture of my academic path and the hurdles I’ve overcome. My cumulative GPA of 2.71 is a testament to a period of significant struggle and growth. Early in my studies, I faced severe test anxiety that deeply impacted my performance. It was a tough time, and I struggled to keep up.

Determined to turn things around, I reached out for help and worked hard to develop strategies to manage my anxiety. My final two semesters, which included some of the most challenging senior and upper-level courses, were where I truly began to see progress. Despite the difficulties, I managed to achieve GPAs of 3.0 and 3.5, reflecting not just my academic improvement, but also my perseverance and growth under pressure.
